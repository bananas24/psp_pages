Distributed systems</h2><blockquote><p>&quot;A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single. coherent system&quot;</p><p>&quot;Andrew S.

This means that one way or the other the autonomous components need to collaborate. How to establish this collaboration lies at the heart of developing distributed systems</li></ul><p>The most known and famous example of distributed system is <code>the Internet</code>. The Internet is seen by the users as a single huge documents repository, that is, a single system able to provide almost any information or service. Notwithstanding the above, we know that is made up of millions of devices located all over the world and interconnected.</p><p>It began with the need to share resources.

Allows running multiple process in parallel.</li><li>Global watch independency.
